## Project Description ##
This project was developed as part of the CS course 'Ubiquitous Texttechnologies' in support of the Text Technology Lab at Goethe University Frankfurt. The goal of the project was to develop a 3D virtual reconstruction of the Synagogue Hoechst, which was destroyed during the period of WWII. The model was then integrated into the Stolperwege projecct, which aims to develop an app for realizing a digital public history of the Holocaust. For the realistic reconstruction we used the Blender tool which is a open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality and computer games. As reference we used original construction plans and architectural recordings as well as an existing [3D model from Architectura Virtualis GmbH](http://www.architectura-virtualis.de/rekonstruktion/synagogehoechst.php?lang=de&img=v&file=0).
